movielibrary
============

Want to build your movie library?

Simply replace FB with your Firebase url.

Replace api_key with your api key for rottentomatoes (in this case).

Add your movies, as you type and click find dvd it'll return results and you can select the matching movie.

Click Add movie and it pushes the movie name, picture url, and filename to your firebase database.

If you don't plan to eventually setup something to control your roku or chromecast using this page, you can remove the filename/play buttons for a simple viewer.
